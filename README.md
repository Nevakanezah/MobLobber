# MobLobber
TTS utility for Warlord mob die, for use with Leder Games' Root
Workshop link: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2676414604

It is Friday morning.
You took the day off work, and the wife and kids are going to be at grandma's
for the whole weekend.
You never told them about who you really were, deep inside.
They lead simple lives, they simply wouldn't *understand.*
It's finally time to live the life you were born for:
That of an unstable, homicidal, anthropomorphic rat.

The idiot who brought you such classics as the Lizard Wizard, Koffin Keeper, and Mole Monger
is inexplicably proud to introduce the Mob Lobber!

Are you tired of having to lift tiny cubes with your feculent paws?
Of course you are, you have people to do that for you!
Gone are the days of squinting uncomfortably at the illegible sigils of the mob die
while everyone else at the table mocks your greatness with crude jeers such as:
"Just make the dice bigger already",
"Hurry up, it's been fifteen minutes", and
"I was gonna complain about you breathing into your mic, but if you're this winded just sitting down then I think you should see a doctor."
Plebians, the lot of them!

The Mob Lobber is a handy dice rolling mat used when playing The Lord of the Hundreds(TM),
the hot new faction from The Marauder Expansion for Root: A woodland game of might and right,
by Leder Games!

One click on its premium velour surface, and it'll select a suit into which your mob tokens can spread!
No more fumbling with tiny dice while gormless onlookers defile your air with claims that:
"pressing F isn't how you roll a dice."
What a glorious future in which we live!

The Mob Lobber: In every way except physical, I am a rat.
